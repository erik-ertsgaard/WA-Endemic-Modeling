# WA-Endemic-Modeling

The Washington Endemic Modeling project is a 2024-2025 research effort from the University of Washington (WTU) Herbarium, with the objective to predict climate-driven changes in 
distribution for species endemic to the Wenatchee Mountains or Mount Rainier. This repository serves to facilitate collaboration between members of the project working on the same
analyses, figures, or writing. 

Collaboration on this repository will follow these loose guidelines,
1. Anyone can create, fix, or comment on an issue.
2. If an issue or change is large enough to warrant a second opinion, create a pull request to be approved by Nick or Erik.
3. If an issue is small and you feel confident in your change, feel free to commit without a pull request.
4. Feel free to suggest and add any more guidelines here!

The analyses and figures will be conducted in R (v4.4.2), with data and packages synthesized from various web sources. The manuscript will be drafted with intentions to publish in a 
peer-reviewed journal in March 2025.





The names, contents, and purpose of each file are described below (upon their creation),

README.md - this file, a brief description of the project and guidelines for collaboration

WA-Endemic-Modeling-Repository.RProj - the R Project file that encases our script and data sources to streamline working directory workflows (it may be easier for users to open this file first)

Endemic-Modeling-Script.R - the master script for species distribution modeling efforts, with data synthesis, adjustments, analysis, and visualization all included

.gitignore - a folder for files we don't want to be tracked by git, but still included in the project
