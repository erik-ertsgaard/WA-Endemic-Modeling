# WA-Endemic-Modeling

The Washington Endemic Modeling project is a 2024-2025 research effort from the University of Washington (WTU) Herbarium, with the objective to predict climate-driven changes in 
distribution for species endemic to the Wenatchee Mountains or Mount Rainier. This repository serves to facilitate collaboration between members of the project working on the same
analyses, figures, or writing. 

The analyses and figures will be conducted in R (v4.4.2), with data and packages synthesized from various web sources. The manuscript will be drafted with intentions to publish in a 
peer-reviewed journal in March 2025.
